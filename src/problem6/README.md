# Architecture Documentation for Live Scoreboard System

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for a live scoreboard system that displays the top 10 user scores on a website. The system will allow users to perform actions that increase their scores, with real-time updates to the scoreboard. Additionally, measures will be implemented to prevent unauthorized score manipulation.

## Architecture Components

### Frontend (FE)

1. **User Interface (UI)**

   - A responsive web application that displays the scoreboard.
   - The scoreboard will show the top 10 users and their scores in real-time.
   - Each user will have a button or action that they can perform to increase their score.

2. **WebSocket Connection**

   - Establish a WebSocket connection to the backend server for real-time updates.
   - The frontend will listen for score updates and refresh the scoreboard accordingly.

3. **API Integration**

   - Upon completion of an action, the frontend will dispatch an API call to the backend to update the user's score.
   - The API call will include user identification (e.g., user ID) and the action performed.

4. **Error Handling**

   - Implement error handling for API calls to manage failed requests or unauthorized actions.
   - Display appropriate messages to users in case of errors.

5. **JWT Authentication**
   - Upon user login, the frontend will receive a JSON Web Token (JWT) from the backend.
   - The JWT will be stored in local storage or a secure cookie.
   - For each API call to update the score, the frontend will include the JWT in the Authorization header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

### Backend (BE)

1. **API Endpoint**

   - Create a RESTful API endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/update-score`) to handle score updates.
   - The endpoint will accept the user ID and the score increment as parameters.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**

   - Implement user authentication using JWT to ensure that only authorized users can update their scores.
   - Validate the JWT on each API request to confirm the user's identity and permissions.

3. **Score Update Logic**

   - Upon receiving a valid request, the backend will:
     - Verify the user's action and ensure it is legitimate.
     - Update the user's score in the database.
     - Emit a WebSocket message to notify all connected clients of the updated score.

4. **WebSocket Server**

   - Set up a WebSocket server to handle real-time communication.
   - When a score is updated, the server will broadcast the updated scoreboard to all connected clients.

5. **Database**

   - Use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user scores and actions.
   - Ensure that the database schema supports efficient retrieval of the top 10 scores.

6. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting on the score update API to prevent abuse (e.g., too many requests from a single user in a short time).
   - Use techniques such as token buckets or leaky buckets to manage request rates.

## Workflow

1. **User Action**

   - A user performs an action on the frontend, which triggers an API call to update their score.

2. **API Call**

   - The frontend sends a request to the backend API with the user ID and score increment, including the JWT in the Authorization header.

3. **Authentication**

   - The backend verifies the JWT to confirm the user's identity and checks if the action is authorized.

4. **Score Update**

   - If authorized, the backend updates the user's score in the database and broadcasts the updated scoreboard via WebSocket.

5. **Real-Time Update**
   - All connected clients receive the updated scoreboard and refresh their UI accordingly.

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**

   - Validate all incoming data to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

2. **Authorization Checks**

   - Ensure that only authorized users can perform actions that affect their scores.

3. **Secure WebSocket Connection**

   - Use WSS (WebSocket Secure) to encrypt data transmitted over WebSocket connections.

4. **JWT Security**

   - Use secure storage for JWTs (e.g., HttpOnly cookies) to prevent XSS attacks.
   - Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms to enhance security.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**

   - Implement logging for all score update requests to monitor for suspicious activity.
   - Set up alerts for unusual patterns that may indicate malicious behavior.

6. **Data Integrity**
   - Regularly audit the scores in the database to ensure data integrity and detect any anomalies.

## Tech Stack

1. **Frontend**:

   - React or Vue.js for building a dynamic user interface.

2. **Backend**:

   - Node.js with Express for handling API requests and WebSocket connections.

3. **Database**:

   - MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user data and scores.

4. **Real-time Communication**:
   - Socket.io for enabling real-time
