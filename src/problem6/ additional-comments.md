### 1. User Experience Enhancements

- **Leaderboard Tiers**: Introduce tiers or categories (e.g., Soccer, Basketball, Badminton) to make the scoreboard more engaging and rewarding.
- **Animations**: Add smooth animations when updating scores to enhance visual feedback for users.
- **Notifications**: Notify users when they move up or down in the rankings, which can increase engagement.

### 2. Security Enhancements

- **Audit Logs**: Maintain an audit log for all score updates to detect and investigate suspicious activities.
- **Token Expiry**: Implement short-lived JWT tokens with refresh tokens to reduce the risk of token misuse.

### 3. Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of your backend service.
- **Database Sharding**: If your user base grows significantly, consider database sharding to handle large volumes of score data efficiently.

### 4. Data Integrity

- **Transactional Updates**: Ensure score updates are handled within transactions to maintain data consistency.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Implement mechanisms to handle potential conflicts when multiple actions attempt to update the same score simultaneously.

### 5. Analytics and Insights

- **Usage Analytics**: Track user engagement and interactions with the scoreboard to gain insights into its popularity and usage patterns.
